## Conservation of Rare Aquatic Invertebrates in Danish Waterways

The Sønderborg Municipality is undertaking a conservation project focused on the protection of rare aquatic invertebrates in its waterways, inspired by the ”Sjældne smådyr i danske vandløb” article in Vand og Jord. The initiative seeks to identify these species, listed for their critical conservation statuses or significant declines, within local water bodies. Led by Alexander Witt Sabroe from the Water and Nature Department, the project aims to analyze existing data and implement safeguarding measures to ensure the preservation of these vulnerable ecosystems.
